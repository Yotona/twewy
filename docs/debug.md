# Debug Menu

The debug menu is a hidden portion of *The World Ends With You* comprised of a massive  collection of overlays that together can be used to test, tweak, and access many parts of the game, notably:

- **Field Testing:** Jump to specific maps, edit details like NPC/Noise density, top brands, etc.
- **Audio/Visual Testing:** Play music/sound effects and view sprites/animations.
- **Menu Testing:** Open various menus, like Phone, Shop, Chapter Select, Mingle Mode, etc.

Several options have unfortunate side effects in this menu. As such, presume caution when using the debug menu. Notable code issues that may be causing these are documented on the relevant files.

- **Freezes:** Trigger hard locks that require system reboot to resume play.
- **Data Corruption:** Completely corrupt and wipe your save file.
